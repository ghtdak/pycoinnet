The pycoinnet library uses py.teset for testing.

If you want to hack on it, it's recommended that you to install py.test and tox in your development virtualenv.

$ pip install pytest

To run just a subset of tests for features under development do something like:

$ cd (project_root_dir)
$ PYTHONPATH=`pwd` py.test tests/scripts_test.py
